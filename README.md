## Hand Gesture Recognition Model
## Overview:
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition system that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from images or video frames. The goal is to enable smooth and intuitive human-computer interaction using gesture controls.
The model leverages a deep learning approach, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a dataset of hand gesture images. This system can be extended for applications like touchless control interfaces, virtual reality navigation, or assistive technologies.
## Features
Preprocessing steps include image resizing and normalization.
Efficient CNN architecture designed for multi-class classification.
Clean implementation supporting easy retraining and extension.
Evaluation metrics to measure model accuracy and performance.
## Results
The trained model achieves encouraging accuracy on the test data, demonstrating its ability to differentiate between several gesture classes effectively.
